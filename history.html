<h1>History</h1>
<p>
  Blog posts are often organized by categories and tags. I've decided to order mine by their original
  publish date (in reverse chronological order). At the top of this list is the latest post, and at
  the bottom is the oldest:
</p>

{% for post in site.posts %}
    <ul class="history-list">
      <li>
        <div class="history-date">{{ post.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y"}}</div>
        <div class="history-title"><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></div>
      </li>
    </ul>
{% endfor %}
