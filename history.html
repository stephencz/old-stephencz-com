<p><em>
  Blog posts are often organized by categories and tags. I've decided to order mine in reverse
  chronological order by publish date. At the top of the list is the latest post, and at the bottom
  is the oldest:

<table style="text-align: center;">
  <tr>
    <th>Date</th>
    <th>Title</th>
  </tr>
{% for post in site.posts %}   
  <tr>
    <td class="smallest">{{ post.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y"}}</td>
    <td><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></td>
  </tr>
{% endfor %}
