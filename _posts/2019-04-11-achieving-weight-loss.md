## Chronology
Here is a chronological account of my weight loss. 
Each month I will write a brief overview of my progress and performance.
If you are interested in my weight loss data a link can be found in the [Raw Data](#raw-data) section.

### Apirl 2019
Coming soon.

## Raw Data
Tracking your progress is an important part of achieving any long-term goal.
The obvious metric of weight loss is body weight.
Keeping a daily record of your weight will, over time, give you an idea of what works and what doesn't.
It will provide insight into your behavioral trends that lead to low or high performance.
And seeing the number on the scale fall, or rise, can be motivating.

Given the nature of this post there is no reason *not* to make my weight loss data public.
To keep this post as tidy as possible I've decided to use a Google Sheets spreedsheet to store and track my weight.
The spreadsheet can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_9dInr2BfdqxnTgyIdZp8wqppK8xwjbZbpzbOWITlIw/edit?usp=sharing).
